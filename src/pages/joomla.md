Sa11y is proudly a core feature within [Joomla](https://www.joomla.org/) as of version 4.1 and above â€” no installation necessary! Within Joomla, Sa11y is recognized as the **Joomla Accessibility Checker,** also referred to as Jooa11y.

## Accessibility Check
When editing an article, you can quickly check a page for accessibility using the **Accessibility Check** button within the Toolbar.

## Settings page
Jooa11y works out-of-the-box, although you can use the settings page to customize the experience for website authors and adapt Jooa11y to your theme. If your website authors can't fix it - don't check it!

1. From the Administrator page, go to **System**.
2. Go to **Plugins**.
3. Search for **Accessibility Checker**.
3. Select **System - Joomla Accessibility Checker**.

For additional assistance navigating through the different settings, select the **Toggle Inline Help** button.

<p class="alert alert-warning"><i class="bi bi-exclamation-octagon-fill"></i> <strong>Note:</strong> Basic knowledge of HTML and CSS is recommended for the following settings.</p>

### Adding exclusions
You can ignore repetitive elements or create exclusions using [CSS selectors](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp) or [HTML sectioning elements](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/landmarks/HTML5.html) within the **Ignore Regions** field. Use a comma to seperate multiple selectors or elements.

### Extra Properties

**Extra Properties** allow you to further customize the experience for content authors or ensure compatibility with your Joomla template. Each prop should have a key and value pair. View a list of <a href="{{ '/developers/props/' | url}}">all props.</a>

## Frequently asked questions

### I do not see any errors or warnings on the page?
Use the "Skip to issue" button or press <kbd>alt</kbd> <kbd>S</kbd>. If you still do not see them, it's most likely an accessibility issue with your theme. Consult a web developer to have a look.

The issue may also be caused by conflicting or overlapping elements. Developers, please view documentation on <a href="{{ '/developers/conflicting-css/' | url }}">conflicting CSS.</a>

### I tagged my PDFs in Acrobat, although I still get a warning?
Sa11y is not able to check for accessibility issues within PDFs. Sa11y will flag all PDFs as a warning regardless if they are accessible or not.

### My videos have closed captions, although I still get a warning?
If your video has accurate closed captions, please ignore this warning. Sa11y is not able to validate or confirm if videos have accurate captions.
