# {{title}}

The **Outline** tab displays the page's heading structure, similar to the table of contents for a book. The page outline gives you a visual idea of how each part is interconnected.

## Example
Review the **Outline** tab in the bottom right corner. Selecting a heading within this tab will also highlight the heading on the page.

<div class="example p-5">

### Dogs
The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it was selectively bred from an extinct population of wolves during the Late Pleistocene by hunter-gatherers.

##### Taxonomy

## Best practices for headings
Headings help organize content and show how sections relate to one another. Headings help readers make it easier to understand how the content is organized and find the information you're looking for quickly. Effective headings are:

- Meaningful, succinct, and clear.
- Break up blocks of text.
- Communicate content relationships and hierarchies.
