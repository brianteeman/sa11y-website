Please note, the Sa11y Drupal module is maintained by [Mark Conroy,](https://www.drupal.org/u/markconroy) and not by Toronto Metropolitan University.

## Install
Visit the [Sa11y module page on Drupal.](https://www.drupal.org/project/sa11y)

Install the module as you would any other Drupal module. Use the `use_sa11y` permission to control which roles can access Sa11y.

Sa11y only appears on pages that do not use the admin theme. Once enabled, visit any page that uses your site’s frontend theme. You’ll see Sa11y in the bottom-right corner.

## Editoria11y
[Editoria11y](https://www.drupal.org/project/editoria11y) is a great alternative to Sa11y! It focuses exclusively on content issues and flags issues directly within the text editor. The Editoria11y library is developed in parallel with Sa11y, and they have almost identical core test suites. Editoria11y focuses on providing a minimalist GUI and provides additional admin-facing tools like site-wide reporting and dismissal governance; Sa11y provides additional author-facing tools like colour checking and readability scoring.
